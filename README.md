# Python Basics

A structured collection of Python concepts, practice files, and experiments created while building a strong programming foundation.

This repository documents my hands-on learning process — from core syntax to object-oriented programming and file handling.

## Structure

The repository is organized by topic:

- `Conditional-Statements/`
- `Loops/`
- `Functions/`
- `String_List_Tuple_Dict_Set/`
- `OOP Concepts/`
- `Exception-Handling/`
- `Files-In-Python/`
- `JSON/`
- `Assignments/`

Each directory contains example programs and practice implementations related to that concept.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is simple:

- Strengthen Python fundamentals  
- Write clean, readable code  
- Understand concepts deeply through implementation  
- Build a base for Data Structures & Algorithms and AI/ML  

This is not a tutorial dump.  
It is a practice-driven learning archive.
